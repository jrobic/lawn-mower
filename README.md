## The Goals of This Project

- Learning Golang and new tools like Kubernetes, ArgoCD, Prometheus and others.
- Microservices based on `Domain Driven Design (DDD)` implementation.
- Communication internally between our microservices with `gRPC` synchronously.
- Implementing various types of testing like `Unit Testing`, `Integration Testing` and `End To End Testing`.
- Using `Health Check` for reporting the health of app infrastructure components.
- Using Docker-Compose and Kubernetes for our deployment mechanism.

## Technologies - Libraries

> This project is a work in progress, new technologies or libraries will be added over time.
>
- **[`Go`](https://go.dev/)** - Build fast, reliable, and efficient software at scale
- **[`gRPC`](https://grpc.io/)** - A high performance, open source universal RPC framework
<!-- - **[``]()** -  -->

## The Domain And Bounded Context - Service Boundary

- `Catalog Service`: The Catalog Service is a service to handle catalog|product related operations
